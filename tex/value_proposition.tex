With the creation of this project, we are fighting for a greater cause. It will help clean up our oceans, which has been destroyed by oil spills and industrial pollution. This is a growing problem that is spreading each day and endangering the animals that live there. That is why constant experimentation on ways to pick up all this trash is crucial. Even if we fail in creating a working robot, this project will help gain insight in new, even cheaper, faster ways to clean up pollution in the water. This could also be a valuable lesson for students to show them how hard it is to clean up garbage, especially when the oceans are so infested with it.
