The project owner and scrum master will change periodically to give everyone a chance for the role. The stakeholders in this project are the judges for the IEEE Robotics competition. They will give or remove points on our robot based on the rules of the competition, just like how a customer will rate the worker based on how well their needs were met. Dr. McMurrough will be our point of contact. Our group members consist of Kartikey, Osama, Paola, Evan and Zach. We have assigned individual tasks for everyone. Kartikey and Osama will learn 3D modeling for potential corner pieces or other custom parts. Evan, Paola and Zach are Learning Arduino coding standards for basic thruster movement. As a group, we will blueprint a basic frame for the robot, secure a testing site for the robot, and when parts arrive, meet with Dr. McMurrough to discuss more possible ideas for basic mechanisms.
