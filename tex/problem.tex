Our reason for creating an underwater, remote-controlled robot is to compete in the IEEE Region 5 Robotics Competition. Every day, 2 million tons of sewage and industrial and agricultural waste are discharged into the world's water (UN WWAP 2003), the equivalent of the weight of the entire human population of 6.8 billion people. Water pollution is a major problem in today's world, which can have dire consequences. The objective of the competition is to demonstrate the use of a tethered underwater robot to collect 'trash' from the ocean floor, midwater, and surface. The robot then will deposit the trash in a proper receptacle. The game field simulates an underwater environment containing objects such as industrial infrastructure and underwater debris. Underwater and surface obstacles and anomalies represent typical operational challenges.
