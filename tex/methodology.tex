The team is working diligently to build a tethered underwater robot that will collect trash from ocean floor, midwater, and surface. The team will mitigate the given problem statement by implementing a robot with thrusters and ballast tanks to master basic movements such as forward, backward, and sideways motion. The team will further perfect the robot's maneuvers by mounting an ethernet camera to see and avoid obstacles in real time. Additionally, the team will install certain mechanisms on the robot to aid the process of trash collection. Finally, the robot will make use of the thrusters and camera to rise to the ocean floor and accompanied by another mechanism it will be able to place the collected trash in a proper receptacle.  

 

Assumptions  

 
\begin {enumerate}
	\item A suitable outdoor or indoor testing location (swimming pool) will be available by the 3rd sprint cycle. 

	\item The delivery of ordered materials and components will be made by Amazon and other vendors by 4th sprint cycle. 

	\item Access to 3-D printer will be available, to print parts for robot's frame, throughout 3rd and 4th sprint cycle.  

	\item The buoyancy calculation for Trash to be collected by robot will hold true upon initial testing of trash collection mechanism.  

	\item Access to thrusters and Raspberry Pi will be available through Dr. McMurrough and Professor Conly by 3rd sprint cycle. 
\end{enumerate}
