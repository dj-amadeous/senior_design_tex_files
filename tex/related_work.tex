Given that this is a robotics competition there are no state of the art solutions that would be acceptable to use. There is one tethered robot that from QYSEA called the fifish-v6 \cite{GYSEA}. This will be the inspiration for our design but no components will be copied except for general position of the thrusters and the number of thrusters to use.
