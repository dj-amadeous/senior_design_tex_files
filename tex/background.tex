Currently, robots exist that are intended to collect waste from the surface of water. A few examples of these types of robots are WasteShark \cite{global} and Urban Rivers \cite{asme}. However, there are no functional robots currently, that can collect waste and debris from the ocean floor and midwater. Our goal is to create a robot that can collect trash from the surface, midwater, and ocean floor. This is important since large quantities of trash accumulate on the ocean floor, which poisons fishes and other marine animals. If a product like ours is successful, it can be adopted by many governments and firms to cleanse their water bodies, and improve the quality of water.
